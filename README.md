# kinnectMe

kinnectMe is an online directory of user created events, where users can connect with others through shared events. Once a user signs up and logs in to the app, they will be able to attend events that are created by other users in their area, or they can create their own events for other users to attend. Those who want to know more about an event can comment on the event details page to connect with the creator of the event, as well as others who are planning on attending.

The goal when creating kinnectMe was to promote self-care by creating an online environment of social connectivity through shared interests. When you log on to the application, you will be greeted with a calming front-end design, which was purposefully done to match the overall theme and goal of the project.
